*HipHop CentOS 5 packages*

This repository contains all packages required for building and installing
hiphop on CentOS/RHEL 5 that don't already exist in the EPEL or IUS
repositories.


Requirements:
EPEL: 'rpm -ivh http://epel.osuosl.org/5/x86_64/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm'
IUS: 'rpm -ivh http://dl.iuscommunity.org/pub/ius/stable/Redhat/5/x86_64/ius-release-1.0-6.ius.el5.noarch.rpm'
HPHP (this repo): 'rpm -ivh http://pkg.tag1consulting.com/hphp/x86_64/hphp-release-1.0-1.el5.noarch.rpm'


To Install:
* Run the above rpm -ivh commands to enable the required EPEL/IUS/HPHP repositories.
* Install the hiphop-php rpm: 'yum install hiphop-php'
  - this should calculate all dependencies and install all necessary packages.
    However, it is likely that you will need to uninstall old versions of
    PHP/MySQL and replace them with the packages provided in IUS (php52,
    mysql51).
  - to uninstall old versions of mysql and php: 'yum remove php* mysql*'
  - try installing hiphop-php again: 'yum install hiphop-php'
  - for Apache/httpd to recognize the newer php version, it will need to be restarted.
* Compile your PHP application with HipHop!


To Rebuild/Update:
* Install/configure Mock:
  - follow install guide at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock#Mock
  - copy .rpmmacros to ~builduser/.rpmmacros and edit as needed
  - copy epel-5-x86_64-hphp to /etc/mock/epel-5-x86_64-hphp on the build box
* Checkout the hiphop yum project
* Copy SRPMS/SPEC files to ~builduser/rpmbuild/{SRPMS,SPEC}
* Install the hiphop SRPM: rpm -ivh ~builduser/rpmbuild/SRPMS/hiphop-php-1.0-1.el5.src.rpm
* Extract and update the hiphop tarball in SOURCES:
  - tar -xzvf hiphop-php.tar.gz
  - cd hiphop-php
  - git pull
  - cd ..
  - tar -czvf hiphop-php.tar.gz hiphop-php/
* Modify SPECS/hphp.spec:
  - vim SPECS/hphp.spec
  - increment the Release:, Release: 1%{?dist} -> Release: 2%{?dist}
  - add a comment detailing the changes
* Build a new SRPM: rpmbuild -bs SPECS/hphp.spec
* Build new RPM with Mock: mock -v -r epel-5-x86_64-hphp SRPMS/hiphop-php-1.0-2.fc14.src.rpm 
* Copy resulting RPMS in to git:
  - cp /var/lib/mock/epel-5-x86_64/result/*.x86_64.rpm RPMS/x86_64/
  - cp /var/lib/mock/epel-5-x86_64/result/*.src.rpm SRPMS/

Tag1 will hopefully soon have a scheduled cron/hudson job that syncs the latest
RPMS from GitHub to the pkg.tag1consulting.com repository.
